# Preprocessor_and_Debugger
Two different projects were created here. The first is a preprocessor which creates an expanded.c code 
and the second is a debugger which debugs expanded.c code according to our instructions. in other words, DenemeC represents the source code we want to debug.
To be able to do this, First of all, we make 'DenemeC' suitable for debugging operations by using a 'preprocessor.c' code. This code is 'expandedC'. 
The code in expandedC will work in harmony with the functions we wrote in debugger.c.
