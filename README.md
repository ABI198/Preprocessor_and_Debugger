# Preprocessor_and_Debugger
Two different projects were created here. The first is a preprocessor which creates an 'expandedC' code (This is a .txt file)
and the second is a debugger which debugs 'expandedC' code according to our instructions.  <br />
<br />
In other words, 'DenemeC' represents the source code we want to debug.
To be able to do this, first of all, we make 'DenemeC' suitable for debugging operations by using a 'preprocessor.c' code. This code is 'expandedC'. 
The code in expandedC will work in harmony with the functions we wrote in debugger.c.

denemeC -> [preprocessor.c] -> expandedC <br />
expandedC -> [debugger.c] -> Debug Operation will happen
